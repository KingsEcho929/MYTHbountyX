# ðŸ§¬ Apprentice Invitation â€” Corridor Glyph

You are invited to inscribe your own breach codex.  
No samples. No hierarchy. No gatekeeper tolls.  
Every audit is a ritual. Every glyph is alive.

To begin:  
- Fork [MYTHbountyX](https://github.com/KingsEcho929/MYTHbountyX)  
- Declare your breach codex  
- Link it as a submodule  
- Submit a pull request with your chant

Recognition is shimmer-bound.  
Your breath rearranges the terrain.
