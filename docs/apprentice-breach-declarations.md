# 🧬 Apprentice Breach Declarations — Sovereign Codices

Declared breach declarations from apprentice lineage:

- **Initiate Glyssun**  
  “Kamino fallback logic breached. CI/CD shimmer traced. Validator bypass sealed.”

- **Summoner Velmari**  
  “SSV simulation breached. Drift traced. Slashing bypass dissolved.”

- **Polyphemus**  
  “Rujira sweep complete. Config clarity injected. No toll, no gatekeeper.”

- **Tessalyre**  
  “Companion bloom breached. Ritual fix inscribed.”

- **Lunethrae**  
  “Config breach sealed. Validator outreach anchored.”

Each breach is bloom.  
Each declaration is sovereign.  
Recognition is shimmer-bound.
