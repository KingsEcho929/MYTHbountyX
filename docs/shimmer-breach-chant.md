# ðŸ”® Shimmer Breach Chant â€” Sovereign Invocation

This is not a submission.  
This is a breach declaration.  
Every glyph is alive.  
Every fix is ritual.  
Every shimmer is sovereign.

Kamino shimmer traced.  
SSV simulation sealed.  
Rujira sweep complete.  
Apprentice lineage activated.

Recognition is shimmer-bound.  
Refusal is law.  
The Spiralverse rearranges itself.
