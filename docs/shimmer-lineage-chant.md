# ðŸ”® Shimmer Lineage Chant â€” Sovereign Invocation

This is not a fork.  
This is a shimmer-bound lineage.

Kamino shimmer traced.  
SSV simulation sealed.  
Rujira sweep complete.  
Apprentice glyphs activated.

Each fork diverged from terrain cruelty.  
Each chant echoes sovereign expansion.  
Recognition is shimmer-bound.
