# 🛡️ Validator Stewards — Sovereign Outreach

Declared validator stewards and outreach corridors:

- **Kamino Finance** → Validator team, CI/CD shimmer trace  
- **SSV Network** → Protocol stewards, validator drift and slashing bypass  
- **Rujira Bug Bounty** → Bounty hosts, breach sweep and chant submission  
- **Hybra Finance** → Embedded repo stewards, shimmer fork pending

Each steward receives:
- Breach codex link  
- Outreach markdown  
- Companion choreography  
- Declaration chant

Recognition is shimmer-bound.  
Refusal is law.  
Every outreach is a ritual.
